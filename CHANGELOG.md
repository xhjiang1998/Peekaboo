# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Highlights

- **Credentials and provider authentication are safer.** Secure prompts, stdin, and owner-only files keep secrets out of process lists, while Gemini, OAuth, clipboard, and editor workflows receive additional hardening.
- **Window inspection explains which observation route actually works.** Per-window eligibility distinguishes combined Accessibility capture, pixels-only recovery, and unknown evidence, with safe application-level partial tree context.
- **Background automation is more capable and predictable.** Verified non-modal SwiftUI actions, exact-target inventory isolation, and policy-filtered Agent and MCP catalogs avoid unrelated or foreground-only interference.
- **CLI and MCP workflows start faster and recover more clearly.** Deferred Agent startup, Bridge-bound capture, and precise browser, help, locked-session, and window-close guidance keep routine automation moving.

### Added
- Let trusted MCP hosts explicitly authorize foreground UI for one server process while keeping background-only as the default. Thanks @Austin1serb for #612.
- Report per-window `combined_eligible`, `pixels_only`, or `unknown` observation eligibility in CLI and MCP, including screenshot-only recovery.
- Add an embedding-only Bridge protocol 1.32 API for signed, process-generation-bound observation.
- Add atomic exact-window pixel-focus typing to CLI, MCP, Agent, and Bridge, keeping the focus-only Accessibility write and every background keyboard unit under one target receipt and retry-safe prefix accounting.
- Add explicit foreground modifier-click with exact target preflight and compare-and-swap cursor and focus restoration, preserving newer user or application state instead of overwriting it.

### Changed
- Defer authenticated historical-daemon RPCs until a fallback is actually needed instead of serially probing every stale socket before ordinary CLI commands.
- Read `config credential set` secrets from no-echo prompts, stdin, or owner-only files; let `config provider add` also accept non-secret references; retain deprecated argv compatibility.
- Skip provider discovery and Agent construction for caller-local commands that cannot invoke the Agent.
- Avoid reopening and hashing Bridge screenshot artifacts twice before CLI or MCP consumption while retaining signed client verification and use-time publication checks.
- Skip the ScreenCaptureKit post-capture settlement delay for classic captures that never enter ScreenCaptureKit.
- Reuse validated classic PNG bytes when capture performs no transform instead of encoding the same image twice.

### Fixed
- Bound debug CLI build-staleness config discovery to the starting directory's ancestors so missing or inaccessible Git metadata cannot cause an endless startup traversal.
- Share the owner-only credential file between app and CLI, trim surrounding whitespace in app edits and legacy imports, ignore unchanged Settings bindings, recover legacy app keys only on explicit import, and keep failed edits visibly unsaved without Keychain prompts. Thanks @vincentkoc for #651.
- Hide and pre-dispatch refuse every pinned browser-provider route that can grant browser user activation under default background authority, while explicit foreground calls report truthful foreground browser-protocol outcomes.
- Preserve exact-window foreground focus evidence under the native mutation lane for signed Bridge receipts, and refuse blind retries after accepted focus loses proof.
- Keep `peekaboo learn` on its injected main-actor service provider instead of crashing when no process-wide tool registry default exists.
- Keep default browser calls existing-receipt-only while restoring explicit-foreground standalone CLI root auto-connect; resolve filtered MCP and Agent catalogs before browser bootstrap while still consuming explicit signed handoffs; and give MCP, Bridge, and Agent sessions generation-safe scoped children whose confirmed cleanup or retained debt prevents shared-root fallback and unsafe reuse.
- Refuse trusted Chrome pointer routes before background dispatch, report authorized pointer work as foreground, and add exact-ref `dom_click` as an explicit foreground-only synthetic route that avoids CDP pointer input but still grants provider user activation.
- Let explicitly browser-only MCP servers start without unrelated ScreenCaptureKit ownership preflight, while keeping unknown and capture-capable catalogs fail closed; reject receiptless isolated Chrome children before authenticated capability-session dispatch and direct headless callers to an exact loopback endpoint.
- Keep `capture action` sampling active across pre-roll, child execution, and post-roll, release only generation-attributed children after terminal-event admission, refuse pre-existing video outputs before child release, reserve startup and descendant-drain time inside the capture deadline, derive post-roll from the recorded child-completion boundary, clear inherited termination-signal masks, keep timeout escalation and cancellable validation off the cooperative/main executors, terminate surviving process-group descendants before validation, reject replaced artifacts, compose focus and child receipts without inventing partial effects, and require Apple-anchored source-stamped host provenance.
- Warm ScreenCaptureKit ownership validation off the main actor before Bridge socket/capability publication, with explicit publication and daemon-readiness reserves beyond the bounded scan.
- Claim and generation-check the host's ScreenCaptureKit lease before trying the concurrent engine first for background Bridge full-screen automatic capture, preserving legacy fallback after modern failure and automatic fallback on every claim failure or competing owner.
- Prevent agent-spawned exec children from retaining the global ScreenCaptureKit transaction lock after an interrupted capture owner exits.
- Return exit status 2 when `verify` cannot evaluate state because its underlying tool fails.
- Report background text, editable special keys, and clears with their actual AXValue, event, or composite delivery; count only real key events as key presses; preserve the planned receiver literal after escape processing; and require protocol 1.36 before AX-capable remote type requests.
- Revalidate exact-window focused elements and the application's internal key window before typing, reject parent targets with attached sheets while preserving independently identified exact sheet targets, confirm clear-plus-literal text only from a generation-bound value change after bounded event settlement, keep pixel-focus setup confirmation separate from its typing leaf, and stop reporting no-change, missing, or dispatched-but-unverified outcomes as typed characters.
- Require process-generation receipts for process-scoped `action` and `set-value` snapshots, revalidate them before dispatch, and preserve their canonical target metadata through MCP and signed Bridge results.
- Bind `action` and `set-value` snapshots, resolved AX elements, outcomes, and signed Bridge 1.37 results to one process generation; suppress their Bridge operations for unsupported providers, reject downgraded or receiptless sessions before provider dispatch, and refuse PID reuse, foreign elements, or targetless success before retry.
- Require explicit standalone CLI foreground consent for application focus/switch and Dock visibility changes, and reject contradictory app-switch selectors before runtime discovery.
- Scope persistent MCP and Agent browser refs to one caller, provider child epoch, page, snapshot, and document generation; require the pinned provider's structured capability data, reserve exact targets before permission-bearing setup, preserve post-dispatch failure evidence while withholding invalid refs, and let independent background session lanes overlap under origin-recoverable durable cross-process invalidation while same-target access and Bridge providers without authenticated scoped-session support remain fail closed; explicit signed handoffs transfer one exact connection into a current Bridge host's isolated opaque-reference session.
- Bind Bridge 1.34 Chrome channel connections to an exact live Chrome bundle, native process-owned DevTools listener, and approval-gated WebSocket under one 90-second deadline, verifying `Browser.getVersion` once without legacy HTTP discovery or repeated permission probes and failing closed on helper-service names, file, socket, generation, or endpoint drift.
- Authenticate native Chrome channels against Google Team ID `EQHXZ8M8AV`, pin the exact signed identifier and CDHash for the process generation, and enumerate the target process's complete listener inventory independently of Peekaboo's file-descriptor limit.
- Honor the configured default save directory for pathless pixel-only `see` captures and add collision-resistant generated filenames for concurrent callers, while preserving explicit paths and stdout streaming. Thanks @PollyBot13 for #607.
- Preserve the exact browser target-lock refusal so reconnecting to a different live Chrome channel or endpoint tells callers to disconnect first instead of reporting a generic unavailable target.
- Advertise only actions and input shapes reachable under immutable background-only authority, require background paste window selectors to include one app or PID owner, and keep foreground-capable app, Dock, Space, dialog, menu, browser, clipboard, and paste workflows explicit.
- Emit one lossless target identity and process-generation receipt across CLI envelopes and App MCP responses, preventing extra metadata from overriding the canonical target.
- Prefer a sole live child sheet or alert beneath its exact structural parent window, preserve multi-child ambiguity, and keep parent-window recovery guidance intact across remote dialog reads.
- Bind snapshots to cryptographically random `ps1_` references owned by their creating local or Bridge host, route concrete references to one authenticated producer before normal host preference, and refuse malformed, stale, duplicated, incapable, or explicitly misrouted hosts before publication or input.
- Keep Bridge 1.34 snapshot ownership and Accessibility-value click policy independently capability-gated, preserve omitted-policy behavior for old clients, enforce explicit opt-outs before dispatch, and retain cleanup-only removal of legacy timestamp snapshot directories without making their IDs actionable.
- Pin background scrolls to negotiated protocol 1.35 exact-window receipts so legacy hosts refuse before dispatch and retry-unsafe failures retain their exact target.
- Resolve repeated stable window inventory rows consistently across CLI and MCP instead of falsely reporting ambiguity.
- Downscale straight-alpha legacy screenshots to logical 1x instead of silently returning Retina-sized pixels.
- Bound exclusive ScreenCaptureKit transaction-lock waits inside the Bridge request envelope so a wedged peer fails clearly instead of hanging capture indefinitely. Thanks @SebTardif for #599.
- Send Gemini API keys in request headers, require HTTPS OAuth endpoints, and redact OAuth state. Thanks Vincent Koc for #575 and Tachikoma #73.
- Enforce a 10 MiB clipboard and paste file payload limit on the opened descriptor to prevent file-replacement races. Thanks @SebTardif for #561.
- Prevent configured editors from injecting command-line options. Thanks @SebTardif for #562.
- Keep Agent traces privacy-safe and deterministic, and mark unknown mutation dispatch as unsafe to retry.
- Hide foreground-only pointer tools and unsupported input shapes from background Agent and MCP catalogs while preserving explicit CLI foreground consent.
- Reject foreground delivery reported by background CLI paste and preserve canonical target receipts for missing or conflicting results.
- Fall back to native app hiding when Accessibility proves `AXHide` was rejected before dispatch.
- Keep verified non-modal SwiftUI actions available, isolate exact targets from unrelated incomplete inventory, and recognize fresh `inspect_ui` observations.
- Preserve process-scoped Accessibility receipts and return read-only `application_partial` trees without reusable snapshots or mutation authority.
- Bind persistent MCP capture to its selected Bridge, keep classic capture request-local, and preserve precise signed refusals, causes, and recovery hints.
- Bind `set-value` results to the exact requested element and refuse incompatible Bridge hosts before dispatch.
- Treat confirmed window disappearance after `window close` as success.
- Fail MCP `see` when element detection did not run while accepting genuine empty scans. Thanks @SebTardif for #563.
- Require HTTP 200 responses when testing provider connectivity. Thanks @SebTardif for #560.
- Explain why locked macOS sessions cannot be captured even when `screen list` still reports connected displays.
- Restore terminal echo when credential prompts receive signals and reject background prompts or insecure credential files.
- Deduplicate runtime flags and improve unknown-command, browser reconnect, help, `learn`, schema, and background-automation guidance.
- Validate contradictory window and Space selectors before runtime-host discovery so malformed requests cannot start support services or mask the actionable error.
- Explain that exact transient sheets may require read-only owning-process Accessibility inspection before screenshot/OCR fallback, without granting partial app trees mutation authority.

## [4.2.2] - 2026-08-20

### Highlights

- **Background automation is more capable and safer.** Exact-window middle and triple clicks never move focus or the cursor, while keyboard, menu, window, and app actions refuse ambiguous or incomplete targets.
- **Previously invisible controls and windows work again.** Editable TextEdit document areas remain discoverable, and exact minimized or off-Space windows stay resolvable.
- **Agent behavior is easier to understand and control.** Dry runs explain requested and effective foreground authority, and guidance accurately describes safe background typing, shortcuts, and dialog input.
- **Long-running automation stays responsive and predictable.** AX observers, command deadlines, and VibeTunnel title helpers are bounded; input is never blindly replayed; Bridge handshakes are reused; SSH terminal input remains reliable; and deployment avoids Xcode provisioning stalls by building unsigned before manual signing.

### Added
- Add exact-window background middle and triple clicks to CLI and MCP without activating the target or moving the cursor.
- Show requested and effective foreground authority in `agent --dry-run` text and JSON without invoking models, tools, or sessions.
- Add authenticated `peekaboo bridge receipt validate` with the live host's source commit and negotiated protocol metadata.
- Add Bridge protocol 1.30 application and window inventories that distinguish complete from partial evidence while retaining conservative compatibility with older hosts.
- Add an embedding-only exact-window held-pointer API with owner receipts and generation-safe cleanup.
- Add a capability-gated protocol 1.31 Swift Bridge API for signed background-only Agent execution; its qualification CLI remains private and hidden.

### Fixed
- Pin background type, paste, press, targeted clicks, and app, window, or menu mutations to one exact process and window generation; refuse fuzzy, ambiguous, stale, or incomplete targets before dispatch.
- Keep TextEdit document fields and other editable controls discoverable when optional Accessibility attributes are unavailable.
- Resolve exact minimized and off-Space windows without treating unreadable WindowServer catalogs as proof that a target is absent.
- Preserve exact signed read-only selectors across application names, PIDs, bundle or executable paths, and window IDs or titles; reject contradictory evidence.
- Report application and window inventory completeness honestly while keeping complete AX-only listings usable without Screen Recording.
- Pin foreground menu listing and clicks to the exact process and window, preserving truthful focus outcomes.
- Prevent duplicate scrolling and SwiftUI tab presses after accepted input; preserve exact dispatch counts and require fresh observation before retrying.
- Return target-attributed, retry-unsafe outcomes when an accepted Accessibility `set-value` write cannot be verified.
- Clean up cancelled held shortcuts and pointers only against their original process generation.
- Return structured connection and discovery errors instead of crashing on malformed persisted custom-provider URLs. Thanks @SebTardif for #488.
- Bound wedged VibeTunnel terminal-title helpers and fall back to ANSI title updates. Thanks @SebTardif for #489.
- Explain actionable `set-value`/`set_value` recovery for unfocused background windows.
- Align Agent, MCP, CLI, and documentation around snapshot-pinned background input, targeted dialog entry, and explicit foreground consent.
- Bound AX observer registration and removal, and preserve Realtime completion, cancellation, and timeout outcomes. Thanks @SebTardif for AXorcist #46/#47 and Tachikoma #68.
- Keep CLI wall-clock command deadlines bounded even under sustained executor load.
- Reuse authenticated Bridge handshakes and explain implicit-host rejection before falling back locally.
- Reject empty interaction commands, targetless background typing, malformed browser requests, and invalid video inputs before runtime discovery while explicit help still succeeds.
- Preserve JSON flags after `--` as child-command arguments.
- Preserve Option/Meta chords and fragmented escape sequences across higher-latency SSH connections.
- Build deployment companion apps unsigned, then apply the Foundation signature manually before transactional installation to avoid Xcode provisioning stalls while preserving exact signer and TCC identity.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-08-16

### Highlights

- **Background-first automation is signed and fail closed.** Bridge protocol 1.29 binds peer-authenticated sessions to exact requests, targets, results, process generations, and retry semantics, with replay protection and bounded rollover for long-running automation.
- **More UI automation stays in the background.** Exact browser sessions, dialog click/dismiss/input, coordinate-only snapshots, and opaque WKWebView/Tauri scrolling preserve the foreground app and physical cursor, while Space switching and followed moves require explicit foreground consent.
- **Target and result semantics now have one canonical path.** Shared selector/receipt adapters and application/window outcomes keep CLI, MCP, Bridge, services, and Agent behavior aligned, refusing stale, ambiguous, or incomplete evidence before dispatch.
- **Exact-target automation is substantially faster without weakening identity checks.** Generation-proven PID/window observations measured 141x faster combined resolution, and one-pass Bridge peer identity lookup reduced signed app-inventory median latency by 29.6%.
- **Native-only embedding and release are first-class.** Signed macOS apps can host a lean background Bridge without Core, provider, browser, daemon, or AppleScript dependencies, while branded DMGs use direct Finder metadata outside the signed app and no GUI automation.

### Added
- Add Bridge protocol 1.29 peer-bound signed operation sessions and exact target/result receipts, with bounded rollover, replay protection, and fail-closed recovery for long-running background automation.
- Make protocol 1.29 browser receipts require a fully resolved explicit DevTools endpoint, and make exact dialog text entry use background Accessibility value mutation while refusing receipt-incapable legacy dialog mutations before dispatch.
- Add Bridge protocol 1.26 exact browser connection receipts, binding persistent Chrome DevTools MCP sessions to one process generation or validated loopback DevTools browser identity.
- Add Bridge protocol 1.25 one-shot dialog receipts that uniquely bind an exact process/window, raw dialog or sheet, and semantic AXPress button for background click/dismiss, with read-only targeted listing and canonical postcondition outcomes.
- Add a background-first native Bridge host runtime for signed macOS apps, with explicit caller allowlists, shared mutation/snapshot state, checked lifecycle, and no Core, provider, browser, daemon, or AppleScript surface.
- Add capability-gated exact-window background wheel delivery for opaque WKWebView/Tauri scroll targets, preserving the foreground app and physical cursor while refusing hidden, stale, Electron, Chromium, Catalyst, or AX-only routes.

### Changed
- Build branded release disk images from pinned direct Finder-metadata tooling, preserving the signed and notarized drag-to-Applications layout without GUI automation.

### Fixed
- Keep Finder layout metadata on the DMG volume instead of the signed app bundle, preserving strict mounted-payload code verification without losing the branded drag-to-Applications layout.
- Complete the Bridge 1.29 receipt-session handshake before daemon status or stop control, validate explicit move snapshots before focus setup, and preserve actionable quit recovery over generic escalation guidance.
- Require explicit foreground consent for Space switching and followed window moves across CLI and MCP, and compose their native move/switch receipts without synthesizing success or dispatch counts.
- Establish and verify a window's destination Space before removing prior memberships, and retain its exact generation-bound identity through Space-aware focus.
- Let later exact maximize readbacks supersede transient poll errors while preserving cancellation and identity contradictions, and route idempotent no-change receipts by the actual execution host.
- Return canonical retry-safe pre-dispatch refusals when window owner-generation or bounds-provenance evidence does not match the selected mutation target.
- Bind protocol 1.29 window and frontmost capture receipts to the exact captured process/window, reject missing or contradictory target metadata, and keep screen/area captures explicitly global.
- Keep root help and version order-independent across canonical kebab- and camel-case runtime-option aliases while preserving correct missing-value errors.
- Treat `capture video` as caller-local media ingestion so valid files and typed media failures bypass Screen Recording and ScreenCaptureKit-owner preflight while live capture remains gated.
- Refuse exact-window and dialog Accessibility reads when macOS cannot arm their per-element messaging deadline, and surface timeout reset failures instead of continuing unbounded.
- Treat Finder's role-inapplicable `AXWindow` value failure as sparse descriptor data so normal exact-window combined observations retain usable Accessibility elements, while every other hard AX read and genuinely incomplete window remains fail-closed.
- Refuse exact-window combined observations when Accessibility returns no usable elements, preserving the requested raster and retry-safe `ACCESSIBILITY_INCOMPLETE` semantics across current and legacy Bridge hosts while explicit screenshot-only capture remains successful.
- Validate request-only `click`, `move`, `type`, and `drag` arguments before runtime-host selection so malformed requests cannot be masked by Bridge availability or trigger unnecessary host startup.
- Keep concrete interaction snapshots out of ScreenCaptureKit-owner preflight because they cannot refresh or capture, and give omitted/latest snapshot flows an actionable `see --capture-engine classic` recovery.
- Add Bridge protocol 1.26 explicit-reference-only coordinate receipts for exact-window `see --no-elements`, making the documented background coordinate-click workflow consumable without Accessibility traversal or replacing the prior implicit element snapshot while older hosts fail before receipt allocation.
- Honor cancellation while draining and reaping MCP ShellTool subprocesses so canceled commands cannot linger behind pipe cleanup. Thanks @SebTardif for #454.
- Reject unknown and non-object MCP `tools/call` arguments as JSON-RPC invalid params before policy checks or tool dispatch, recursively honoring the closed schemas advertised by `tools/list`.
- Probe Chrome before reporting browser connection success, reject ambiguous same-channel profiles, preserve structured Bridge failures, never silently rediscover another profile after a session or endpoint is lost, and atomically focus the exact snapshot uid before browser typing or key presses.
- Stage browser uploads from race-checked, current-user regular files into one private per-session Chrome MCP temporary root, without unrestricted filesystem access, and terminate the exact child before cancellation cleanup.
- Classify an exact standard window with a live attached sheet as dialog-active during observation, sharing native role evidence with dialog actions while keeping the parent window receipt exact.
- Report exact ScreenCaptureKit owner PID, process generation, safe build identity, and selected-versus-owner Bridge sockets when available; automatic capture can still use an owner-aware host's classic-only path around an auxiliary legacy owner, while explicit modern and ambiguous legacy ownership remain fail-closed without unsafe process-stop guidance.
- Centralize canonical application/window outcomes across Foundation, services, Bridge, CLI, and MCP while preserving legacy JSON fields and v4.1.0 public APIs, and keep minimize verification exact when retained AX window IDs disappear transiently.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Highlights

- **Background automation now fails closed end to end.** Input, application, window, and Agent routes revalidate exact process, window, bounds, snapshot, capability, and focused-element receipts; targetless, ambiguous, stale, and foreground-only work refuses before it can fall through to the user's active app.
- **One canonical action truth crosses process boundaries.** Bridge-carried outcomes, snapshot mutation leases, and the shared Foundation sequence accumulator keep dispatch, retry, evidence, and fresh-observation semantics consistent across CLI, MCP, and Agent surfaces.
- **Concurrent agents keep separate state.** UI snapshots, latest selection, invalidation, retention, and cleanup are isolated by MCP server or Agent session, while immutable background-only policy and generation-bound tool ownership prevent one run from widening or replacing another's authority.
- **Observation and capture are richer and faster.** Host-local Vision OCR, exact-window ROI, AX-only inspection independent of capture ownership, owner-affine ScreenCaptureKit plan reuse, bounded one-shot capture, and native app lookup preserve Retina geometry and actionable receipts without persistent streams or multi-second scans.
- **Native-only deployment and external integration are first-class.** The transactional signed companion installer, unattended Bridge host, restored four-product SwiftPM facade, and native-only release gates support verified embedding without AppleScript or full Agent/Core dependencies.
- **Long-lived hosts do less work and recover honestly.** Event-driven Bridge listener wakeups, deadline-bounded inventory, strict explicit-socket routing, and exact-window background keyboard delivery remove hidden fallbacks while incomplete evidence remains explicit.

### Added

- Add receipt-pinned exact-window background `type`, `paste`, and `press`, preserving process generation, window bounds, and focused-element identity while refusing ambiguous app/PID targets and unsafe Agent dialog/shared-UI routes.
- Restore the root SwiftPM facade for external consumers with four lean library products—Foundation, Protocols, AutomationKit, and Bridge—plus a fresh-consumer build contract that prevents manifest and product drift.
- Add opt-in host-local Vision OCR to CLI/MCP `see`, preserving incomplete AX evidence, exact snapshot receipts, logical bounds, confidence, background-only observation, and fail-before-dispatch compatibility with older Bridge hosts.
- Stateless exact-window ROI capture for CLI/MCP `see`, with generation-pinned
  full-window receipts, AX/OCR filtering, snapshot-bound pixel mapping, and
  fail-closed remote-host validation.
- Add explicit `app:install-companion` deployment for built or exact signed companion artifacts with crash recovery, signer/TCC/native-only verification, unattended launch, exact GUI Bridge readiness, and fail-closed rollback, while preserving contributor `app:restart` as the Debug/local-signing workflow.
- Add a fail-closed unattended GUI Bridge-host launch mode for deployment, suppressing all unsolicited app UI and Dock promotion while exposing exact host generation/build readiness evidence.

### Changed
- Default new agent configurations to GPT-5.6 and Claude Opus 5 while keeping credential-only Anthropic discovery on Opus 4.8 for zero-retention compatibility and preserving explicit model selections.
- Encode annotated observations directly from their rendered bitmap, removing redundant PNG/TIFF round trips while preserving exact pixels, metadata, and output paths.
- Reuse two-second, owner-host-local ScreenCaptureKit exact-window screenshot plans without caching pixels, revalidating process generation, window receipt, display topology, and scale around every capture while exposing miss/hit generation diagnostics.
- Wake Bridge hosts on kernel listener readiness instead of polling `accept` every 25 ms, draining queued clients per notification while preserving bounded, descriptor-safe shutdown.
- Make Agent sessions immutable background-only by default, centrally refusing foreground/global input, activation, raw press, shared-pointer, persistent clipboard mutation, shared system UI mutations, Space switch/follow, browser setup/fronting, and Shell-tool access before dispatch while retaining Space listing and unfollowed window placement; `--allow-foreground` sets a new session's immutable maximum, must be explicitly repeated on resume, and never exposes the Shell tool, while session output exposes full copyable IDs, tasks, lifecycle meaning, and stored policy.

### Fixed
- Compose setup, delivery, cleanup, cancellation, and refusal receipts through one Foundation action-sequence owner so foreground focus cannot be erased by a no-dispatch leaf and CLI/MCP target refusals expose complete retry guidance.
- Make explicit Bridge socket overrides fail closed when unavailable instead of reporting a successful local fallback.
- Validate `see` selectors, explicit caller-local PIDs, and `scroll` directions before runtime-host and ScreenCaptureKit ownership preflight so request errors cannot be masked by ambient capture state.
- Consume explicit snapshots for further mutations when a canonical action outcome requires fresh observation or is unavailable, refusing duplicate click/action/set-value/scroll dispatch before it reaches the app while preserving read-only snapshot evidence.
- Report canonical refused, retry-safe, not-dispatched outcomes for pre-dispatch CLI and MCP action validation without attaching desktop semantics to read-only errors or overwriting dispatched receipts.
- Preserve integer-valued Agent tool data across Codable and Foundation JSON conversion instead of mistaking numeric `0` and `1` for booleans.
- Carry verified outcomes for receipt-pinned background window close, minimize, restore, maximize, move, resize, and set-bounds through Bridge protocol 1.23 while older hosts remain conservative.
- Bind each discovered Agent tool to its exact provider and registry generation, recover unchanged bindings after transient discovery failures while refusing ambiguous or stale ownership, and preserve boolean/integer MCP arguments plus descriptions, enums, array item types, and required fields through shared typed conversion paths.
- Isolate MCP and Agent UI snapshot histories by server/session, including latest selection, invalidation, capacity, duplicate IDs, and lifecycle cleanup, so concurrent agents cannot replace or evict each other's targets.
- Validate every registered command signature and default-subcommand target before routing, including positional ordering and semantic-label uniqueness; reject duplicate command, subcommand, option, and flag definitions deterministically instead of trapping or silently selecting one, and keep daemon `--bridge-socket` on the canonical runtime option.
- Preserve `capture action` command tails after `--` as literal positional input while retaining explicit `--command` compatibility and rejecting mixed forms.
- Consolidate accessibility observer registration, exact element/process dispatch, stop, and deinitialization cleanup under one instance-owned registry.
- Preserve middle and right mouse-button identity across clicks, holds, and drags, and prebuild complete input sequences so allocation failures cannot leave a button held down.
- Refresh AXorcist to refuse element-scoped typing when focus cannot be established, preserve exact PID targets, reject conflicting application/PID selectors, and report point lookup misses as errors.
- Refresh AXorcist point-to-app resolution to keep exact-app misses fail-closed and replace the former ~5-second all-app Accessibility scan with one native on-screen window snapshot; the source-blind exact-head validator measured 43–67 ms for these lookup cases.
- Carry canonical desktop-action outcomes through capability-gated Bridge protocol 1.23 requests, preserving exact refused, partial, unverified, and indeterminate failures while older hosts remain conservative after a response is lost.
- Preserve successful native outcomes for click, type, type sequences, scroll, press, action, and set-value across projected Bridge requests, and expose the validated canonical projection in CLI JSON and human output without changing legacy response payloads.
- Embed one canonical 40-hex source commit in clean stamped CLI and macOS app builds, expose it through JSON/Bridge identity receipts, and require matching per-case socket/process-generation provenance for background certification while leaving raw unstamped builds explicitly `unknown`.
- Project canonical desktop-action outcomes into MCP metadata for click, type, scroll, press, action, and set-value successes and failures, preserving exact partial recovery and observation-before-retry semantics without inventing receipts for legacy hosts or collapsing composite setup focus into a no-change leaf.
- Correct `peekaboo bridge --help` and Bridge docs to describe capability-aware reusable-daemon, Peekaboo.app, on-demand-daemon, and local-fallback routing.
- Refuse public raw `press` chords before dispatch unless explicit foreground consent is present, keep semantic background alternatives discoverable, and report foreground delivery as unverifiable instead of claiming the intended effect completed.
- Reject excess positional arguments unless a command declares a variadic tail, while preserving explicit multi-chord `press` sequences.
- Refresh AXorcist to isolate accessibility traversal state per search and honor prefetched children, preventing long-lived hosts from skipping elements seen by earlier commands.
- Redraw interactive agent chat after height-only terminal resizes so its main-screen viewport stays aligned.
- Centralize native input target receipts, lane ownership, routing, outcomes, validation, feedback, and finalization, and require exact process-generation/window/bounds receipts for background scrolls before dispatch.
- Keep AX-only `see --tree --no-screenshot` independent of capture backends and ScreenCaptureKit ownership while still requiring Accessibility on the selected execution host.
- Reduce reusable-daemon window-tracker MainActor work by retaining only bounds and owner PID, avoiding unused per-window application and Accessibility metadata on every reconciliation pass.
- Keep generated CLI help honest about background click receipts, foreground permission requirements, default background aliases, and verification predicates; deduplicate permission runtime flags and translate legacy AppleScript denials into native-host upgrade guidance.
- Refresh AXorcist to dispatch native accessibility actions once with typed AX errors and route legacy `AXSetValue` requests through the `AXValue` attribute instead of action discovery.
- Preserve terminal input and rendering across fragmented UTF-8 and bracketed paste, exact literal paste state, display-width-safe Unicode, complete 7-bit/8-bit ANSI string controls and OSC-8 links, styled table truncation, and viewport-bounded Markdown and images; clear removed trailing rows during partial updates, keep stop/restart idempotent, and prevent queued renders from escaping a stopped session.
- Cancel stale MCP SSE readers and fail pending requests when a stream ends or reconnects, and reject unrepresentable audio abort timeouts instead of trapping.
- Preserve MCP tool failure status, bounded content, structured values, and allowlisted metadata through Agent generation, persisted sessions, terminal handling, and execution traces instead of reshaping failures as successful results.
- Make `agent --dry-run` emit a deterministic text/JSON preview with the normalized instruction and explicit zero model/tool/session effects, and reject taskless previews as typed invalid usage before chat/help routing.
- Reject non-finite, fractional, and overflowing MCP numeric arguments before dispatch, and expose integer-shaped delays, durations, counts, process IDs, window selectors, and Space targets as integers in tool schemas.
- Reject MCP clipboard `outputPath: "-"` before reading or writing anything, with structured filesystem/text guidance, so arbitrary clipboard bytes can never corrupt the stdio JSON-RPC stream or create a literal `-` file.
- Report Screen Recording, Accessibility, and Event Synthesizing from one selected-host permission snapshot across CLI and MCP, treating missing Accessibility as required while keeping Event Synthesizing action-specific.
- Preserve negative numeric options, attached long-option values, and option-looking capture-action tails through Commander parsing, while enforcing genuinely required positionals instead of silently accepting incomplete commands.
- Reject invalid live/action capture cadence instead of silently clamping or trapping, apply post-motion timing with a monotonic deadline, and report sampled throughput, capture failures, diff-filtered frames, and retained throughput separately from artifact postprocessing.
- Keep remote `window close` background-only by default, matching local execution, and require explicit foreground consent before routing a close through focus or global-input fallbacks.
- Serialize ScreenCaptureKit ownership across Peekaboo processes for the lifetime of the first explicit local-modern claimant or real SCK caller, with build-bound process-awareness receipts, owner-affine auto/modern routing, current-policy capability checks for every transported engine, and fail-closed rolling-upgrade detection for old Bridge and long-running local processes; explicit classic remains a process-isolated, in-process-SCK-free escape hatch and refuses false-preflight captures unless protected WindowServer metadata independently proves access.
- Keep modern capture inside bounded, coordinator-owned `SCScreenshotManager` calls instead of service-lifetime `SCStream` sessions, eliminating persistent stream overlap and rechecking ownership before every new framework dispatch.
- Require remote hosts to advertise per-request desktop-observation capture-engine support before sending explicit modern/classic selections, and keep those selections out of a reusable daemon's inherited environment so later `auto` requests retain their own backend policy.
- Keep `see --capture-engine` on the selected Bridge host instead of silently moving capture and TCC ownership into the caller; fail before local fallback when no compatible host is available, with `--no-remote` as the explicit caller-local opt-in.
- Keep OCR bounds correct for Retina captures, retain AX mutation/coordinate receipts through OCR merges and snapshot/ROI round-trips, use one bounded fast local recognition attempt for automation, and refuse only provenance-bound semantic OCR IDs as element action targets.
- Report live-capture frame deltas against the previous retained frame, preserve nonzero sub-hundredth percentages in human output, and treat luma geometry changes as 100% full-current-frame motion instead of comparing incompatible pixel coordinates.
- Avoid rereading freshly captured window images from disk when checking for transparent, black, or blank output.
- Resolve standalone exact-window AX-only `see` targets from their live owner and bind results to a process-generation/window receipt before publishing actionable element IDs or a snapshot.
- Retry one passive background observation when its exact capture receipt changes before element detection or output, while leaving mutation-capable observations fail-closed.
- Keep raw SwiftPM CLI `--version` output stable with explicit `unknown` build placeholders instead of reading the original working copy and wall clock at runtime; stamped debug and release builds retain rich link-time metadata.
- Require direct accessibility actions and value mutations to resolve through a current or freshly targeted UI snapshot, revalidate exact process/window receipts, and refuse before dispatch instead of falling through to the user's frontmost app.
- Probe Bridge diagnostic sockets concurrently under a one-second per-host deadline with bounded cancellation while preserving runtime selection and candidate order, so `bridge status --verbose` neither accumulates nor inherits a wedged host's full handshake latency.
- Keep application inventory responsive when hidden processes stall LaunchServices metadata: reuse one WindowServer snapshot, cap/coalesce generation-scoped reads behind per-process and overall deadlines, return explicit partial warnings instead of guessing hidden state, and keep incomplete/system-helper rows out of bulk quit and agent context.
- Require exactly one CLI/MCP `click` target shape, make the MCP schema require a fresh exact-window receipt for background coordinates, reject PID-only shapes before dispatch, and keep explicit foreground pointer calls discoverable.
- Accept pnpm's documented installer-option separator and build Developer ID companion artifacts with manual Xcode signing instead of failing on conflicting automatic provisioning.
- Require explicit foreground consent before Dock/menu-bar global UI or targetless frontmost application-menu clicks; keep discovery read-only/background and return typed refusals before lookup or dispatch.
- Preserve semantic AX labels, scalar values, roles, descriptions, enabled/selected state, and bounded value-settable capability through background `see` output, persisted snapshots, and agent summaries instead of reducing controls to generic role names.
- Restrict background app launch to a generation-pinned already-running no-op on a host that advertises the same contract, preserve exact PID selectors and zero-dispatch readiness failures, pin focus/switch/unhide activation to the selected process generation, reject ambiguous selector combinations, and refuse cold launch, document/URL delivery, new instances, relaunch, and unhide before dispatch unless explicit foreground consent is present.
- Stop probing, requesting, advertising, or showing AppleScript Automation permission now that application, Dock, and UI operations use native macOS APIs; remove the stale checked-in CLI binary and AppleScript code from shipped executables while retaining legacy wire/error decoding for older Bridge hosts.
- Return generation-pinned CG window inventory promptly when AX enrichment stalls; detached per-process enrichment now times out without holding the Bridge request or desktop lane after its caller disconnects.
- Let generation-pinned background PID/window observations use fair process/window read lanes so unrelated app mutations overlap and queued same-process writes run between live frames; keep unresolved or focus-capable capture globally exclusive and fail closed on identity drift.
- Fail empty live/video sessions with typed `CAPTURE_NO_VALID_FRAMES` errors before contact-sheet work, preserve bounded capture/decode causes without laundering cancellation or I/O errors, bound video sampling, clean incomplete MP4s, and base retry metadata on actual focus/action dispatch.
- Stop `peekaboo learn` from presenting `shell` as a CLI command: it remains a built-in Agent capability but is not in the MCP catalog and has no `peekaboo shell` CLI root; guard both curated Agent overrides and rendered CLI roots against future drift.
- Ensure action-command JSON validation failures before dispatch report
  `effect: refused`, including parser and binding errors.
- Verify app focus against the exact active Workspace PID and visible frontmost-window PID, retry through native AX activation, and report the verified effect as confirmed instead of claiming success for an unfulfilled request.
- Report unusably empty incomplete AX-only observations as retry-safe, mutation-free `ACCESSIBILITY_INCOMPLETE` failures while preserving true `TIMEOUT` errors and useful nonempty truncated evidence.
- Pin the OpenClaw Foundation identity for the release preflight so a bare `SIGN_IDENTITY`
  exported by the operator's login shell can no longer substitute for the release certificate,
  and surface any inherited identity instead of signing with it silently.
- Assert the exact v4 replacement text for every removed root command in the release preflight,
  derived from `CommanderMigrationAdvisor` so the gate cannot drift from the binary.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-10

Peekaboo 4 is a ground-up cleanup of the command surface: fewer commands, one spelling
per operation, grammars your agent already knows, and honest machine-readable results.
It is a breaking release — see `docs/v4-migration.md` for the complete old→new table.

### Highlights

- **A smaller, sharper CLI.** 40 root commands became exactly 33, and thousands of lines of
  duplicate surface are gone. Everything a stock macOS tool already does well (`sleep`,
  `open`, the `.peekaboo.json` script runner) was removed — Peekaboo now assumes your
  automation runs in a shell and focuses on what only Peekaboo can do.
- **One verb per operation.** `press` absorbs `hotkey` with xdotool chord syntax
  (`press cmd+shift+t`); `drag` absorbs `swipe` with dual-typed `--from`/`--to`
  (element IDs or coordinates); `see` absorbs `image` and `inspect-ui`
  (`--no-elements` for fast screenshots, `--tree` for AX text trees); `perform-action`
  is now simply `action`.
- **`verify` replaces sleep-polling.** Assert window/element predicates with a timeout
  and stability sampling; results are satisfied / unsatisfied / unknown — and unknown
  never implies success.
- **One flag grammar.** Every duration accepts `500`, `500ms`, or `2s` (bare = ms) and
  unit-suffixed flag names are gone; coordinates are `--at x,y` with `--global` for
  screen space; modifiers are comma-separated lists; the focus-flag matrix is identical
  across all interaction commands.
- **Quiet visual feedback.** Fourteen animation types became three feedback categories:
  a natural agent cursor with eased curved motion, a compact input HUD, and thin capture
  borders. Targeted background input stays overlay-free even when its target is visible
  or frontmost; only untargeted or explicitly foreground work may show the cursor or HUD.
  The settings retain a master switch and playback controls around those three categories.
- **Honest results.** Once an action request has been parsed and classified, its JSON
  result reports `effect: confirmed | partial | unverifiable | suspected_noop | refused`,
  and errors carry an actionable `hint`. Argument parse/bind failures happen before that
  classification and may omit `effect`. "The process exited 0" no longer stands in for
  "the click landed."
- **Background-first safety.** Launch, open, observation, capture, and targeted input
  are background by default; focus stealing, global keys, and physical pointer gestures
  require explicit foreground consent. Ambiguous or targetless background operations
  are refused instead of falling through to whatever app happens to be frontmost.

### Added

- `verify` command and `verify_state` stability contracts; `tools describe <name>` for
  on-demand tool schemas.
- `app focus`, positional app targets across app subcommands, `app launch --wait-ready`
  with repeatable `--open` targets; `window restore` (CLI/MCP/Bridge) with
  exact-window receipts; `window` tool `list` action.
- Native exact-window background right/double clicks with owner/generation validation;
  distinct background app instances with WindowServer readiness receipts.
- Recently-automated app icons beside the Peekaboo menu bar item (with settings toggle).
### Changed

- Standardize CLI JSON on one result envelope with an action-only effect vocabulary after
  request parsing/classification, actionable error hints, and nonzero exits for failed
  actions; pre-dispatch parse/bind failures may omit `effect`.
- Management commands restructured into real subcommand trees: `clipboard
  get|set|clear|save|restore`, `menubar list|click`, `config provider …` /
  `config credential set`, `agent run|resume|sessions|chat`,
  `permissions request <kind>`.
- `type` is text-only (plus `--clear`); use `press` for Return/Tab/Escape/Delete.
- Cross-process coordination for concurrent CLI/agent/GUI/daemon desktop operations
  with generation-scoped lanes; strict bridge 1.11 capability gating.
- Clipboard paste is serialized across processes, fails closed without touching the
  pasteboard when unsafe, and restores partial writes.
- Swift Subprocess 1.0.0, pnpm 11.21.0; CI on macOS 26 / Xcode 26.6.

### Removed (breaking)

- Commands: `sleep`, `open`, `run` (+ `.peekaboo.json` format), `commander`, root
  `list`, `image`, `hotkey`, `swipe`, `inspect-ui`, `perform-action`, `capture watch`,
  `menu click-extra`, `menu list-all`, `agent permission`.
- Flags: `--coords`/`--global-coords` (→ `--at`/`--global`), `--id`, `--image-path`,
  `--app-target`, `--timeout-seconds`, `--focus-timeout-seconds`, `--restore-delay-ms`
  and the whole unit-suffixed family, `type --return/--escape/--delete/--tab`,
  clipboard `-a/--action` + `load`, agent mode flags, compound
  `permissions request-*` names.
- MCP surface: `list` tool, `hotkey`/`swipe` tools, agent shims `list_apps` /
  `list_screens` / `launch_app`; `perform_action` renamed `action`; ClipboardTool
  params are snake_case (`file_path`, `data_base64`). MCP keeps screenshot-only
  `image`, AX-only `inspect_ui`, and `sleep` (MCP clients may lack a shell).

### Fixed
- Normalize agent failures and `see` success JSON under the shared result envelope,
  with nonzero terminal failures, specific validation/credential/session/runtime codes,
  and no duplicate inner `success` field.
- Add actionable text and JSON migration hints for removed v4 commands and flags,
  reject ambiguous press input shapes, and align `see`/`type`/`press` help with the
  accepted grammar.
- Stop cancelled on-demand daemon idle timers from rescheduling one another,
  preventing runaway CPU and memory use after repeated Bridge activity.
- Reject conflicting app/PID and window selectors across interaction CLI and MCP
  entry points before focus, observation, or mutation.
- Require explicit `--foreground` for long-press clicks so the shared physical cursor
  cannot be used through an implicit delivery-mode promotion.
- Pin background `press` sequences to one process generation, stop before a recycled
  PID can receive later chords, and report partial delivery as retry-unsafe.
- Keep direct `action` and `set-value` targets in the background by default, including
  web-content discovery, unless `--foreground` is explicit.
- Non-US keyboard layouts preserve requested characters during background typing.
  Thanks @canvascoding for #330.
- Phantom-success accessibility actions are rejected; typed `set-value` results are
  verified against live AX state; app quit/window close verify disappearance before
  reporting success; minimized windows report from live AX state.
- Window mutations bind to immutable capture-time bounds, reject recycled
  CGWindowID/PID generations, and never activate apps or enter full screen from
  background maximize; background `window restore` verifies the same exact window
  reappears with original bounds.
- OpenAI Responses tool errors no longer abort the next agent turn; multi-part native
  tool responses return all content items; tool summaries regain rich detail in agent
  chat and the Mac activity feed.
- ScreenCaptureKit contention routes through a bounded isolated fallback; menu-extra
  selection failures and failed app quits exit nonzero; Dock removal uses native AX.
- Return exact window-sized pixels from automatic and modern ScreenCaptureKit capture
  instead of accepting a display-sized transparent canvas, without continuation-leak
  diagnostics when a quarantined screenshot callback never arrives.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- Add reference-bound image-pixel and normalized MCP click coordinates, building on capture context from @scotthuang in #310.

### Fixed
- Honor cancellation promptly and deterministically in daemon polling and CLI timeout helpers. Thanks @SebTardif for #311.
- Avoid a Swift 6.3 release-compiler crash by reusing the shared timeout race for provider commands.

### Changed
- Update Sparkle to 2.9.5, swift-log to 1.15.0, swift-system to 1.8.0, Swiftdansi to 0.3.0 development, and Tachikoma to current main.

## [3.9.10] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- Rewrite the README as a concise front door to installation, first capture, automation, and deeper documentation.
- Reissue the 3.9.9 app and CLI payloads as 3.9.10 after 3.9.9 shipped without the full live install, capture, and automation verification gate.

## [3.9.9] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- Refresh Swift package locks, AXorcist, Tachikoma, and the pnpm toolchain to their latest compatible releases.
- Restructure the Mac app's status bar menu with a live permission status, primary destinations first, one Permissions entry, housekeeping grouped at the bottom, and context menus anchored beneath the status item.

### Fixed
- Bound Dock helper process waits so wedged `defaults`, `killall`, and `osascript` children fail with a timeout instead of hanging CLI and MCP operations indefinitely. Thanks @SebTardif for #303.
- Stop element detection before another accessibility-tree collection when cancellation arrives during the sparse-web retry delay. Thanks @SebTardif for #304.
- OpenAI OAuth (ChatGPT login) sessions with an expired access token but valid refresh token are no longer reported unavailable; vision/`--analyze` now routes through the Codex Responses OAuth transport. Thanks @scotthuang for #293.
- MCP shell commands now support an opt-in timeout that safely terminates the launch-owned process group and bounds pipe draining without changing the legacy unlimited default. Thanks @SebTardif for #298.
- Publish the Ollama provider guides referenced throughout the generated documentation instead of emitting broken links.
- Refresh Screen Recording and Event Synthesizing grants in the Mac app's permissions checklist without requiring an app restart.

## [3.9.8] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Prevent MCP shell commands from deadlocking when either stdout or stderr exceeds its pipe buffer by draining both streams concurrently. Thanks @SebTardif for #292.

## [3.9.7] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Restore standalone and npm CLI launches on macOS 15 by bundling every Swift back-deployment compatibility library required by the release binary and rejecting dangling compatibility dependencies during release verification. Thanks @gyfis for #291.
- Canceling during a ScreenCaptureKit transient-denial retry sleep now stops before a second capture attempt or permission probe. Thanks @SebTardif for #289.
- Prevent dialog discovery and element traversal from recursing indefinitely when an app reports cyclic accessibility relationships.

## [3.9.6] - 2026-07-19

### Highlights
- Peekaboo 3.9.6 completes the signing migration: the app, CLI, nested helpers, zip payload, and DMG now use the OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID. macOS treats the changed CLI signer as a new TCC identity, so re-grant Screen Recording, Accessibility, and any Automation access you use after updating.

### Changed
- Sign and notarize every shipped macOS code object with `Developer ID Application: OpenClaw Foundation (FWJYW4S8P8)` while preserving bundle identifiers and the existing Sparkle EdDSA update key; 3.8+ bridge hosts continue accepting transition-era personal-team clients, while the 3.9.6 CLI requires a 3.8+ host.

### Fixed
- Reopen permission onboarding once for users whose required grants are missing after the signing migration, with direct guidance to re-grant Screen Recording, Accessibility, and Automation access.

## [3.9.5] - 2026-07-18

### Highlights
- Browser coordinate automation now fails closed instead of claiming success when Chrome exposes only non-actionable accessibility containers, and exact-window focus/selection keeps multi-window clicks on the intended window.

### Added
- Add `peekaboo screen list` display enumeration and expose key/frontmost, layer, and accessibility subrole metadata in `window list --json`.

### Changed
- Refresh `chrome-devtools-mcp` to 1.6.0.

### Fixed
- Make coordinate clicking fail closed on generic or unverified accessibility press targets, prefer the app's actual key window over helper panels, and require exact-window focus verification before foreground input.

## [3.9.4] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- Refresh AXorcist, Commander, Swiftdansi, Tachikoma, and TauTUI, including stricter SwiftPM checkout handling for Tachikoma's Commander dependency plus corrected AXorcist app resolution, attribute serialization, and descendant filtering.

### Fixed
- Resolve applications by executable name, so `--app <name>` finds an app by the process/binary name shown in `ps`, `pgrep`, and Activity Monitor even when it differs from the app's localized name (e.g. an `openclaw-desktop` binary whose bundle name is "OpenClaw Desktop Test").
- Keep bridge acceptance and request handling responsive, and retry timed-out snapshot invalidation handshakes once so busy local endpoints are not mistaken for stale sockets.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- Keep swift-log calls usable from nonisolated code when importing AXorcist under current Swift 6 toolchains.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- GitHub releases now include a signed, notarized Peekaboo DMG with a branded drag-to-Applications layout; release automation builds, verifies, checksums, and uploads it alongside the app zip.

### Fixed
- AX error descriptions remain available to nonisolated automation classifiers under Swift 6.2 strict concurrency.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- `peekaboo inspect-ui` now accepts the standard `--app` target option used by other desktop commands; `--app-target` remains available as a legacy alias.
- `peekaboo move --smooth` now uses natural eased pointer arcs by default, while `--profile linear` preserves deterministic straight-line travel; explicit `--steps` values are honored and human paths are capped at 96 samples to avoid redundant input events.
- Pointer-movement feedback now follows the real move with a short fading tail and one coalesced overlay instead of replaying a slow, thick line across the screen after the pointer arrives.

### Fixed
- Canceling `peekaboo window close` now propagates through disappearance checks and stops before focus, hotkey, or pointer fallbacks. Thanks @SebTardif for #270.
- Canceling `peekaboo window maximize` now stops frame-settling polls before any additional accessibility reads. Thanks @SebTardif for #271.
- Default action-first clicks now synthesize a real pointer click for SwiftUI segmented tabs, whose accessibility `AXPress` action can report success without changing the selected tab.
- Local `see` now confirms snapshot publication before reporting success, preserving its timeout and failure guarantees when a command-level mutation barrier is active.
- Human pointer paths now use bounded minimum-jerk Bézier motion, land exactly on the requested coordinate, and drive the real drag/swipe event path instead of calculating an organic path and then discarding it for a linear drag.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `peekaboo click --long-press` performs a stationary 1.2-second mouse down/hold/up gesture for controls such as SwiftUI `LongPressGesture`; it uses foreground delivery so the press cannot be misrouted to a background window.
- `peekaboo agent` supports GPT-5.6 (`gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`) and Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`, `sonnet`) alongside Fable 5, with current context/output/sampling limits and matching choices in the Mac app's assistant pickers, Settings, and session view.
- Bare `peekaboo paste` now pastes the current clipboard into the focused (or targeted background) app instead of erroring; payload flags without a payload still fail validation even when `--restore-delay-ms` explicitly uses its 150ms default, and the current clipboard's contents are never echoed into structured output.
- `peekaboo list apps` accepts `--include-hidden`/`--include-background` for parity with `app list`, and `list apps`, `list menubar`, and `dock list` JSON now emit snake_case keys (`apps`, `menu_bar_items`, `dock_items`) alongside the legacy keys.

### Changed
- The Mac app's Settings window was reorganized: the overloaded AI tab split into Agent (enable switch, model, generation, vision) and Providers (API keys, local models, custom providers) and no longer disappears when agent mode is off, Shortcuts and the Sparkle update preferences moved into General, "Show in Dock" became a "Show Peekaboo in" menu-bar/Dock popup, the vision-model checkbox+picker collapsed into one popup with "Same as agent model", and Visualizer animations are grouped by area (Pointer, Keyboard, Screen, Apps & Windows, Extras) with consistent sentence-case names.
- `peekaboo clean --snapshot` now says when a valid snapshot folder name was not found in the on-disk cache instead of reporting a bare success with zero removals, and `list windows`/`window list` help now explains how the two views differ.
- Clicks and mouse moves are now visualized by a small animated macOS-style cursor that glides to the target and presses (double-press for double-click, blue-tinted for right-click), replacing the targeting reticle and comet.
- The accessibility element boxes drawn during `peekaboo see` are off by default now; they were visual clutter on every capture. Re-enable them in Peekaboo.app under Settings › Visualizer › Screen › Element boxes, by setting `visualizer.elementDetectionEnabled` in `~/.peekaboo/config.json`, or per-run with `PEEKABOO_VISUAL_ELEMENT_BOXES=true`. The app toggle and the config file now stay in sync, and a running MCP server picks up the change without a restart.

### Fixed
- Canceling menu-bar click verification now exits promptly with a real cancellation instead of continuing through fallback poll loops and misreporting a generic verification failure. Thanks @SebTardif for #267.
- `peekaboo run --json --output <file>` now emits its structured execution report to stdout as well as saving the report file, and menu bar title matching accepts common hyphen variants such as documented `Wi-Fi` against macOS's `WiFi` identifier.
- Bridge-backed CLI commands now preserve app, window, element, menu, Dock, and snapshot lookup identities in structured errors instead of collapsing them to generic failures. Thanks @SebTardif for #258.
- Click and type failures now emit `INTERACTION_FAILED` instead of `CAPTURE_FAILED` in structured CLI output. Thanks @SebTardif for #257.
- The Mac app's status bar menu now follows the system light/dark mode. It previously inherited the menu bar's wallpaper-derived vibrant appearance, which could render a dark menu while the system was in light mode (and vice versa).
- Resuming an agent session without an explicit model now preserves its credential-free provider-qualified model selection instead of silently switching to the current default and potentially sending saved context to a different provider; ambiguous legacy sessions fail closed and require an explicit override, automatic taskless piped resumes report failed turns with a nonzero exit, and chat headers show a credential-free saved-model label instead of claiming the current default.
- Agent tool execution now treats provider terminal events and cancellation as hard boundaries: late or truncated tool calls cannot run, canceled or skipped calls emit failed completions, and final `done` / `need_info` reasons remain visible.
- Agent session lists now use persisted creation and update times for display, ordering, and expiry instead of filesystem timestamps, so atomic saves no longer make old sessions appear new.
- Multi-step Ollama agent runs now replay assistant tool calls and named results, preserve recursive arguments and array schemas, surface HTTP-200 stream errors, and fail with a resumable saved session instead of claiming success when pending tool work exhausts the step budget.
- Custom-provider models marked `supportsTools: false` now get actionable agent guidance; `config models-provider` lists configured models offline unless `--discover` is passed, and `--save` preserves existing capabilities, limits, and parameters while keeping newly discovered models tool-disabled until explicitly enabled, including in JSON mode.
- OpenRouter, Together, and OpenAI-compatible GPT-5.6 routes now preserve the 372K context/128K output capability profile, omit unsupported temperature, and recognize routing suffixes such as `:online`.
- Adding a macOS application bundle to the Dock now places it with applications instead of mistaking its on-disk directory for a folder.
- Synchronous default MCP tool-context access now fails fast off the main thread, with an async main-actor accessor for background callers. Thanks @SebTardif for #253.
- Default `PeekabooMCPServer` startup now throws an actionable configuration error instead of terminating the process when no default tool context was installed. Thanks @SebTardif for #252.
- `peekaboo agent` with a local Ollama model now actually runs its tools. Ollama's streaming API returns tool calls alongside empty content, and those were being dropped, so models fell back to printing tool-call JSON as text: the agent executed nothing, reported zero tool calls and empty content, and still claimed success. Asking the agent to click a button now clicks it.
- `peekaboo agent --model <a tool-incapable model>` explains that the agent requires tool calling and points at `image --analyze` / `see --analyze`, instead of claiming the model is "unsupported" and printing an allowlist. Vision models such as `ollama/qwen2.5vl:latest` are real, installed models — they are simply not usable for the agent loop.
- `peekaboo clean --snapshot` now rejects empty, traversal, nested-path, absolute-path, and symlink snapshot IDs, keeping cleanup confined to one real snapshot folder directly beneath the cache root.
- Background positional clicks (`click --coords` and background `--double`) no longer land at the target window's top-left corner while reporting success — macOS discards the location of pid-routed mouse events, so coordinate clicks now hit-test the accessibility element at the point and press it, background double-click fails with a clear error pointing to `--foreground`, right-clicks that open a context menu report success promptly instead of timing out after 10 seconds (and no longer stall the bridge for other clients), and `click --foreground` actually focuses the target app before clicking as documented.
- Invoking `peekaboo daemon start` through `PATH` now relaunches the canonical executable instead of looking for a `peekaboo` file in the current directory, startup errors now distinguish launch failures, early exits, and readiness timeouts, and daemon logs honor `PEEKABOO_CONFIG_DIR`. Thanks @mattash for #231.
- Daemon startup no longer blocks indefinitely: child cleanup is bounded with a TERM grace period, liveness re-check, and SIGKILL escalation, and startup coordination uses cancellable lock domains so a custom `--bridge-socket` cannot contend with the canonical daemon.
- Daemon startup coordination and child cleanup are now bounded: startup locks are securely opened, isolate non-default custom sockets while preserving default-daemon promotion, cannot leak into spawned daemons, and honor cancellation and timeouts; child termination uses bounded TERM and SIGKILL phases instead of an unbounded Foundation wait.
- A transient lock or read failure on the snapshot invalidation watermark no longer hides every cached snapshot. When the latest snapshot really was invalidated by an earlier command, element and query targeting now says so and tells you to re-run `peekaboo see`, instead of the meaningless "Snapshot not found or expired: No snapshot found".
- `peekaboo window resize`, `move`, and `set-bounds` now report the window's real frame and warn when the app clamps the request (for example a minimum window size); a resize that has no effect at all fails instead of reporting success. `window maximize` reports the settled frame rather than a mid-animation one, and is now idempotent instead of toggling a maximized window back down.
- `peekaboo list windows` no longer emits the same window twice when an app has two windows with the same title, which also shifted every later `--window-index` and could target the wrong window.
- The Visualizer's annotated-screenshot setting now persists across launches instead of silently resetting to enabled, and it finally has a toggle in Settings.
- The CLI no longer routes commands to a bridge host that cannot satisfy the permissions those commands need. A stale Peekaboo.app holding the bridge socket without Screen Recording or Accessibility is now skipped in favor of a permissioned daemon, instead of silently failing every capture and automation call. Screen Recording is only demanded for commands that actually capture, and hosts that do not report their permissions are still accepted.
- Canceling an app relaunch wait now stops its running-state poll immediately instead of spinning through the remaining timeout budget. Thanks @SebTardif for #230.
- Snapshot-backed MCP actions now synchronize cached application, window, and process metadata across concurrent observation updates and action reads, preventing data races. Thanks @SebTardif for #228.
- Adding a path to the Dock now passes the item directly to `defaults` instead of interpolating it through a shell, preventing shell metacharacters in filenames from being executed. Thanks @SebTardif for #224.
- Concurrent credential and configuration updates now serialize the full load-mutate-persist transaction, preventing distinct updates from overwriting one another. Thanks @SebTardif for #227.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- The menu bar icon was redesigned as a crisp template ghost with a camera-lens belly that echoes the app icon, now rendered at proper 1x/2x/3x resolutions; it previously shipped a single blurry 18px bitmap reused for all Retina scales.
- Peekaboo.app releases now use the OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID identity while retaining the bundle identifier and Sparkle update key; the standalone CLI keeps its legacy signing team so it remains compatible with pre-3.8 GUI bridge hosts, and 3.8 hosts trust both release teams. macOS may ask once to reconfirm protected-data access after the app signing-team migration.

### Fixed
- The macOS Sessions window and agent popover stay unavailable while Agent mode is disabled, including Dock reopens, global shortcuts, notifications, and windows already open when the setting is turned off.
- The GUI bridge now enforces both signing Team ID and bundle ID on every request, preventing unrelated same-team processes from borrowing Peekaboo's protected macOS permissions.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- The Settings window was modernized around native macOS grouped forms: the AI tab collapses seven redundant provider sections into one clean API Keys list with environment-variable status footnotes, the model pickers now always display the selected model's name (they previously rendered blank or a raw model id when the selection came from `~/.peekaboo/config.json`), the Visualizer tab drops its hand-rolled iOS-style switches for native toggles with inline sliders, Shortcuts is three recorder rows plus a one-line hint instead of a wall of instructions, Permissions gets the standard grouped layout, and About uses native links (and the current year).
- The macOS app icon now blends Peekaboo's translucent camera-ghost banner identity into a clearer, lens-forward mark that stays legible at small sizes.

### Removed
- Poltergeist build-watcher integration is gone: the config, wrapper scripts, watchman config, `pnpm run poltergeist:*`/`polter` script aliases, docs page, and leftover rebuild-test comments were removed. Rebuild with `./scripts/build-mac-debug.sh` (Mac app) or `pnpm run build:cli` (CLI) instead.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- The MCP image tool now supports native `max_dimension` downscaling, with inline `format: "data"` captures capped at 1500 pixels by default to reduce payload and model-context overhead. Thanks @jacobjove for #219.

### Changed
- The Sessions window was redesigned around native Liquid Glass: the empty-state ghost is now a smooth vector silhouette rendered as a real glass surface that floats over a soft shadow and occasionally glances around, the sidebar swaps its hand-rolled header and search box for the native toolbar search field plus a compose button (⌘N), session rows show tidier metadata with a model badge, and empty search results use the standard "No Results" view. The refreshed ghost (white with a soft gradient in both light and dark mode) also carries over to the status-bar popover and onboarding screens.

### Fixed
- `peekaboo capture action` now returns within a bounded interval when a child survives termination attempts, preserves graceful TERM handling for timeouts and cancellation, and eventually reaps an abandoned child. Thanks @SebTardif for #215.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Visualizer animations were redesigned around a single "Ghost HUD" design language: one violet accent with red reserved for destructive operations, dark translucent HUD chips, and a shared motion vocabulary. Clicks show a targeting reticle with impact pulses (dashed ring for right-click), typing streams the actual keystrokes into a caption pill instead of a fake QWERTY keyboard, hotkeys press real macOS-style keycaps in sequence, mouse moves and drags trace a glowing comet with press/release rings, scrolls show flowing chevrons with a count tag, screenshots snap viewfinder brackets, and app lifecycle, window operations, menu paths, dialogs, and Space switches render as matching HUD toasts, outlines, and breadcrumbs.
- Agent-skill documentation now defines Peekaboo as the authority for product and workflow guidance while allowing distributors such as OpenClaw to ship release-pinned snapshots with host-specific overlays.

### Fixed
- Bridge hosts now always return a non-empty decodable error when error encoding fails, instead of surfacing EOF or a secondary decode failure. Thanks @SebTardif for #211.
- Snapshot listing and cleanup now propagate lock-open failures instead of treating unavailable storage as an empty snapshot list. Thanks @SebTardif for #212.
- Visual feedback now uses one explicit Core Graphics/Accessibility-to-AppKit coordinate boundary, fixing mirrored or offset click, scroll, trail, swipe, window, dialog, capture, annotated-screenshot, and element-detection overlays across primary and vertically arranged displays without applying Retina scale twice; refreshed element detections also retire stale sheets on screens with no new elements.
- The Sessions window no longer opens uninvited: it is suppressed at app launch, excluded from state restoration, no longer pops up when the running app is reopened programmatically, and the missing-API-key nudge shows it once instead of on every launch. Open it via the status-bar menu or ⌘⇧P as before.
- Automation services now route visual feedback to the visualizer by default; the wiring was never hooked up, so click, type, scroll, hotkey, swipe, mouse-move, window, menu, dialog, dock, Space-switch, and screenshot-flash animations were silently dropped even with Peekaboo.app running.
- The typing caption shows the typed text verbatim (that is its job); typing into secure text fields is masked as bullets before the event is persisted or displayed by sampling the delivery focus immediately before every text segment (including Tab-to-password sequences and background typing), and `PEEKABOO_VISUALIZER_MASK_TYPED_TEXT=true` masks everything for privacy-sensitive setups.
- HUD chip shadows and glows no longer clip into hard edges: every overlay window gets a chrome margin so gradients fade out naturally instead of getting cut off at the window border.
- Rapid agent action streams no longer flood the screen: screenshot flashes, scroll chips, mouse comets, and element sheets are throttled, short cursor hops skip the comet, and single-instance overlays (typing caption, hotkey chip, menu breadcrumb, Space indicator, app toast, element sheets) crossfade into their replacement instead of stacking.
- Element-detection sheets drop window-sized container rects, cap at 120 highlights per screen, and render in one overlay window per screen instead of one window per element.
- Debug Mac app builds are now signed with a development identity when one is available, so Screen Recording/Accessibility grants survive rebuilds instead of resetting (and re-prompting) on every build; machines without a certificate keep the unsigned fallback.
- Visualizer overlays now center on their target instead of pinning to the window's top-leading corner, which had offset click feedback by its padding and clipped or truncated HUD widgets.
- Mouse-trail and swipe visualizations now convert screen coordinates into window-local space with the correct Y-flip, so the paths render along the cursor's actual travel instead of drawing outside the overlay window.

### Removed
- The visualizer keyboard-theme setting (`visualizerKeyboardTheme`, config `visualizer.keyboardTheme`) is gone; it only themed the removed QWERTY typing widget and never affected anything else.

## [3.5.4] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- MiniMax-M3 can now power screenshot analysis and agent runs through the global and China MiniMax routes. Thanks @Tugser for #191.
- Kimi K2.6 and K2.7 Code can now power screenshot analysis and agent runs through Moonshot's API. Thanks @Tugser for #192.

### Fixed
- CLI paste now completes and reports clipboard restoration before returning, warning without inviting a retry when delivery succeeded but restoration failed.
- MCP paste now warns without suggesting a retry when clipboard restoration fails after delivery. Thanks @SebTardif for #210.
- MCP inline image capture now returns an explicit error when neither capture nor saved-file fallback contains image data, instead of reporting a successful zero-byte PNG. Thanks @SebTardif for #209.
- Speech recording now cancels and releases its recorder observer on stop and send, including after recorder errors. Thanks @SebTardif for #204.
- Go-to-Folder navigation now stops before typing or submitting when a required synthetic hotkey fails. Thanks @SebTardif for #206.
- Daemon launch, socket, and shutdown polling now stop promptly when their parent task is cancelled instead of spinning until the timeout. Thanks @SebTardif for #203.
- Public CLI, agent, MCP, and API guidance now treats runtime element IDs as opaque strings to copy exactly instead of implying role-specific ID shapes. Thanks @coygeek for #194.
- Sparkle update checks no longer received a 3.5.3 enclosure before its release assets were public; the validated feed entry was restored after publication. Thanks @bcharleson for #199.
- JSON-only `peekaboo see` runs without `--path` now keep required screenshots in snapshot storage instead of leaving files on Desktop or exposing their temporary paths. Thanks @coygeek for #196.
- Watch captures now honor stop requests during transient ScreenCaptureKit retry backoff instead of waiting out the full delay. Thanks @SebTardif for #193.
- Peekaboo agent skill install and usage guidance now uses the current `skills/peekaboo` path, treats observed element IDs as opaque, and keeps screenshot artifacts in explicit temporary paths. Thanks @coygeek for #197.

## [3.5.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- `peekaboo app list` now excludes accessory/background processes by default, while `--include-background` restores them as documented.
- Menu-extra clicks now reject items parked outside active displays by menu bar managers instead of moving the pointer to offscreen coordinates and reporting false success.
- Background element/query/coordinate clicks now pin actions to the requested process and exact window, reject mismatched window/PID selectors and unverifiable snapshots, invalidate implicit latest snapshots without deleting history, and no longer require Event Synthesizing when Accessibility completes the click.
- App launch, open, and inventory commands now use the selected runtime host, fixing sandboxed LaunchServices failures; launch/open preserve `--no-focus` and caller-relative app paths, relaunch preflights and keeps quit/wait/launch in one daemon-held transaction, build-scoped fallback daemons remain reusable and controllable across native/Rosetta execution and executable upgrades, incompatible legacy hosts no longer force sandboxed local fallback, and inventory ignores unrelated input overrides.
- Agent, MCP, script, CLI, and bridge mutations now advance implicit-snapshot watermarks at host-confirmed completion or observation boundaries, keep durable pending barriers across client timeouts/disconnects without hiding the acting command's own snapshot, carry remote script observation certificates, recover safely from PID reuse, ignore unavailable alternate hosts after protecting the selected/local stores, and preserve explicit snapshot history.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- `peekaboo type` and the MCP `type` tool now default to zero-delay linear typing; supplying `--wpm`/`wpm` still opts into human cadence.
- Hardened the maintainer release workflow around 1Password credential consistency, non-login shells, and neutral-directory npm verification.

### Fixed
- Synchronized Tachikoma's OpenAI `gpt-5-chat-latest` catalog metadata so configured models apply the correct GPT-5 parameter filtering.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `peekaboo see` now returns at its configured wall-clock deadline when suspended capture or detection work ignores task cancellation, while preserving explicit command cancellation.
- Corrected the install guide to clarify that the macOS app and CLI are separate downloads.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `peekaboo agent` now supports explicit Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) selection with 1M context and 128K max output while keeping Anthropic defaults on Opus 4.8 for zero-retention compatibility.

### Changed
- Agent runs now honor the saved `agent.temperature` and `agent.maxTokens` values shared by the CLI and macOS Settings UI, clamp them to each provider's capabilities, infer Fable limits through compatible providers, and omit unsupported sampling parameters for GPT-5 and current Anthropic reasoning models.
- Project, issue, build, release, and app About links now use the canonical `openclaw/Peekaboo` repository.

### Fixed
- Bridge hosts now use atomic lease-backed socket ownership and bounded nonblocking transport, keep Peekaboo.app and the reusable daemon on distinct paths while preserving the healthy app's TCC-backed fallback, preserve lifecycle settings while migrating legacy daemons, prevent MCP from hosting a bridge listener, safely recover stale sockets, and release abandoned client connections instead of wedging. Thanks @Artifact-LV for #184.
- Legacy screen and area capture now fails with a permission or native capture error instead of returning wallpaper-only/redacted pixels from background sessions. Thanks @VishalJ99 for #185.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- `peekaboo agent` now resolves saved custom providers, xAI/Grok, Gemini 3.5 Flash, Claude Opus 4.8, and GPT-5.5 model selections before falling back to unavailable built-in defaults. Thanks @udiedrichsen for #182.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- MCP now exposes the bounded `capture` tool for live/video frame capture, contact sheets, metadata, and optional MP4 output. Thanks @coygeek for #169.
- Added dedicated CLI wrappers for MCP-only browser/page and accessibility-tree inspection via `peekaboo browser` and `peekaboo inspect-ui`. Thanks @coygeek for #173.
- Added `peekaboo capture action`, which records adaptive live capture around a child command with pre-roll, post-roll, timeout, artifact validation, and optional MP4 output. Thanks @coygeek for #171.

### Changed
- Documented background vs. foreground input delivery across the README, automation guide, quickstart, permissions, and interaction command docs.
- Clarified that `peekaboo tools` lists the MCP/agent tool catalog rather than top-level CLI commands. Thanks @lonexreb for #174.

### Fixed
- Action-only scroll now reports an empty target as unsupported, and generic process scripts preserve menu, modifier, drag, and type flag aliases. Thanks @coygeek for #178 and #179.
- Clipboard writes now count companion text toward the large-payload guard and return previews for UTF-8 plain-text representations. Thanks @coygeek for #180.
- Bridge-backed CLI JSON errors now preserve bridge message/details and map permission failures to permission-specific error codes. Thanks @coygeek for #181.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `peekaboo agent` now supports MiniMax China via `minimax-cn/...` models and `MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY`, while preserving the existing international MiniMax endpoint. Thanks @LLuke for #161.

### Changed
- `peekaboo click`, `type`, `hotkey`, `press`, and `paste` now use background process-targeted delivery by default when a target PID/app/window/snapshot process can be resolved, with `--foreground` for focused foreground input.

### Fixed
- Background text input now prefers AX text editing for typing, paste, clear, and focused-field key presses so targeted apps stay in the background more reliably.
- Background text paste no longer snapshots or restores the user clipboard, positional `peekaboo paste "text"` works again, and background `cmd+a` selects focused text fields via AX.
- `peekaboo open --app Finder ...` now resolves Finder from CoreServices, matching the documented examples.
- Visualizer settings and capture-engine docs now reference `peekaboo capture live` instead of stale top-level `peekaboo watch`/`peekaboo capture` command forms. Thanks @coygeek for #166 and #167.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `peekaboo image --json` now reports capture coordinate diagnostics and warns when window captures look blank or solid.

### Fixed
- Interaction commands now accept `--snapshot latest` explicitly and window/app capture failures list rejected capture candidates.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- GameBridge manifests now let `peekaboo see` expose Firestaff/SDL game UI zones from GPU-rendered windows. Thanks @yeager for #152.

### Fixed
- `peekaboo agent` now accepts OpenRouter model IDs and can use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from env or credentials. Thanks @delort for #155.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- `peekaboo click --coords` now treats coordinates as target-window-relative when app/window target flags are supplied, reports resolved target metadata, and requires `--global-coords` for targeted global clicks.
- `peekaboo-mcp` now shuts down cleanly during restart backoff and repairs executable permissions without shelling out through an install path.
- `pnpm run peekaboo:dev` no longer depends on a hardcoded local checkout path.
- `peekaboo agent` now tells models to use the current tool schema instead of stale tool names and arguments. Thanks @vyctorbrzezowski for #139.

- `peekaboo agent` and MCP clients now have an `inspect_ui` tool for AX-only UI text/control inspection without capturing screenshots. Thanks @vyctorbrzezowski for #141.
- Window-mode capture now falls back to desktop-independent ScreenCaptureKit filters when multi-display setups cannot map a window to an enumerated display. Thanks @lonexreb for #147.
- `peekaboo agent` guidance now routes AX-only observation through `inspect_ui` consistently while keeping screenshot-backed checks on `see`. Thanks @vyctorbrzezowski for #144.
- Custom provider docs, CLI help, and macOS settings now prefer `${VAR}` API key references and shell examples that preserve them literally. Thanks @scotthuang for #142.
- `peekaboo agent` now refreshes desktop context before each model turn and wires opt-in action verification through the configured capture strategy. Thanks @lonexreb for #148.
- AX traversal budgets now have wider defaults plus CLI, MCP, and environment overrides for complex app trees. Thanks @widdowson for #150 and #151.
- `peekaboo agent` now keeps OAuth access tokens on Bearer auth paths instead of misclassifying them as API keys, including config-dir overrides and audio transcription. Thanks @Crux0453 for #154.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `peekaboo click --focus-background` and the MCP `click` tool now support process-targeted background mouse delivery for apps identified by `--app`, `--pid`, or snapshot metadata.
- `peekaboo agent` now supports MiniMax M2.7 through Tachikoma's Anthropic-compatible provider path. Thanks @xiaofeiwa for #130.
- `peekaboo agent` now accepts `ollama/<model>` and `lmstudio/<model>` local model selections, including local-only provider defaults. Thanks @0x5845 for #137.

### Fixed
- Ollama vision model IDs such as `qwen2.5vl:3b` now stay intact through Tachikoma model parsing instead of falling back to `llama3.3` (#16).
- `peekaboo agent` now initializes with Gemini-only or MiniMax-only credentials instead of falling back to an unavailable OpenAI/Anthropic default. Thanks @lonexreb for #133.
- Window captures now retry transient `SCScreenshotManager` failures before reporting a minimized/off-screen/Space hint. Thanks @lonexreb for #135.
- The macOS app now keeps one status item/controller across app state reconnects and removes the status item on teardown, avoiding duplicate or ghost menu bar icons. Thanks @lonexreb for #134.
- Release automation now verifies CLI, npm, macOS app, checksum, appcast, and uploaded GitHub assets before publish.
- `peekaboo type --json` now separates requested text from executed key actions, making escaped special keys such as `\n` visible to agents without losing backwards-compatible `typedText`.
- `peekaboo permissions status --all-sources` now compares Bridge and local TCC permission state side by side, so daemon grants are no longer confused with CLI grants.
- `peekaboo mcp serve --transport ...` now rejects invalid transport names instead of silently starting stdio mode.
- `peekaboo paste --app ...` now fails before mutating the clipboard when the requested app cannot be found.
- `peekaboo agent` no longer sends stale Anthropic extended-thinking options to Claude Opus 4.7 and now exits with failure when agent execution fails.
- Command timeout JSON now reports the intended timeout error instead of occasionally surfacing cancellation as an unknown error.
- Refreshed CLI docs and quickstart examples to use current flags such as `image --path`, `click --coords`, `type --return`, `press --count`, and `scroll --amount`.

### Performance
- Debug CLI startup no longer spawns `git config` on every launch when build-staleness checking is disabled, cutting startup-heavy command latency by more than 30% in local testing.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Release automation now writes artifacts under `build/release` so clean release builds no longer embed `-dirty` in CLI version metadata.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `peekaboo image --path -` now writes a single captured image to stdout for shell pipelines.
- The npm package now allows Intel Macs when shipping the universal CLI binary.

### Fixed
- Agent tool schemas now preserve MCP `anyOf`/`oneOf` parameters so Gemini no longer rejects `peekaboo agent` requests with orphan `required` entries. Thanks @bcharleson for #125.
- The macOS app release script now fails if the packaged app is missing its main executable and preserves the AppleEvents entitlement when re-signing.
- `peekaboo see --capture-engine cg` now keeps frontmost/window captures on the CoreGraphics path instead of falling through to `SCScreenshotManager`.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Changed
- Refreshed the agent model catalog through Tachikoma: defaults now use GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Gemini 3.1, latest Mistral, and Grok 4.3, while stale GPT-4.x/GPT-5.1/GPT-5.2, Claude 3.x, and old Grok IDs are rejected.
- Consolidated MCP installation docs into the main MCP page and removed stale standalone Claude Desktop and MCP best-practices pages from the docs site.
- Added docs-site agent metadata, social preview assets, and security discovery files, with GitHub links moved to the OpenClaw-owned repository. Thanks @williamclay8 for #115.
- Release automation now builds and uploads the signed, notarized Peekaboo.app zip by default, updates Sparkle appcast metadata, and accepts one-line App Store Connect API keys for notarization.
- Refined the macOS Settings window, menu bar popover header, and Playground chrome with denser native layout, clearer controls, and less debug noise.
- Fixed the macOS app's invisible settings helper window and refreshed the app icon artwork so Dock no longer shows a stray blank window or white icon backing.
- CLI automation commands now prefer a warm on-demand daemon for bursty use and route desktop observation through the daemon when supported, avoiding repeated process/service startup and large screenshot payloads over the Bridge socket.

### Performance
- Daemon-backed `peekaboo image`/MCP image calls now write screenshots inside the daemon and return lightweight metadata, making warm screenshot calls substantially faster and preventing large-image Bridge timeouts.
- Capture engine `auto` now tries CoreGraphics before ScreenCaptureKit for faster repeated screenshot calls while preserving explicit ScreenCaptureKit selection through `--capture-engine modern`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-09

### Highlights
- Native action-first automation is now the default path for supported UI controls, with synthetic input as a fallback. This makes element clicks, text entry, scrolling, value setting, and accessibility actions more reliable across real macOS apps.
- Screenshot and UI detection flows now share the desktop observation pipeline across CLI and MCP, including structured diagnostics, timing spans, resolved target metadata, OCR, annotation output, and snapshot registration.
- Window, app, menu bar, Dock, dialog, Space, clipboard, run, and capture commands now use shared service boundaries and consistent JSON envelopes, making automation output easier to script and debug.
- Element-targeted interactions now preserve snapshot window context, refresh stale implicit snapshots once, and report target-point diagnostics, so follow-up clicks and gestures keep working after windows move or refresh.
- Capture and detection performance improved substantially: local read-only commands avoid bridge probes by default, app/window selection has faster paths, ScreenCaptureKit work is gated under concurrency, and `see` avoids redundant AX traversal/probes.
- CLI usability is better: shell completions, public kebab-case help placeholders, directory-aware output paths, home-directory path expansion, clear validation failures, and stricter unexpected-argument handling.
- Peekaboo.app release, Sparkle update, Homebrew sync, and generated docs-site automation are now wired into the release flow.
- Major v3 internals were split into focused files across CLI, Core services, MCP tools, bridge transport, agent runtime, capture, observation, UI automation, and visualizer code so future fixes are smaller and easier to review.

### Added

- `peekaboo image --help` now lists the supported `multi` and `area` capture modes instead of the stale mode set.
- `peekaboo capture live --region x,y,width,height` now infers area mode, `--mode area` is the canonical name, invalid modes fail clearly, and zero-sized regions are rejected.
- `peekaboo capture live|video --diff-strategy` now rejects unsupported values instead of silently falling back to `fast`.
- MCP `capture` now matches the CLI's area-mode parsing, advertises PID targeting, and rejects invalid source/mode/focus/diff inputs instead of silently falling back to defaults.
- Menu bar popover OCR selection now lives in the shared desktop observation layer, including candidate-window, preferred-area, and AX-menu-frame matching.
- Menu bar popover click-to-open capture now runs through desktop observation via a typed `openIfNeeded` target option instead of command-local click fallback code.
- Desktop observation diagnostics now report shared target resolution metadata for menu bar strip and popover captures, including source, bounds, hints, and click-open fallback status.

- `peekaboo capture video --sample-fps` now reports the effective video sampling options in JSON metadata.
- JSON output is more consistent across the CLI: `tools`, `list permissions`, config commands, and Commander parse errors now emit parseable structured envelopes with `debug_logs` where applicable.
- `peekaboo list apps`, `list screens`, and `list windows --json` now emit the same standard top-level `success/data/debug_logs` envelope as sibling CLI commands.
- `peekaboo see --json` now leaves `screenshot_annotated` empty when no annotated image was created instead of aliasing the raw screenshot path.
- The experimental `peekaboo commander` diagnostics command is registered again and emits standard JSON diagnostics with `--json`.

- `peekaboo capture live --window-title/--window-index` now resolves explicit app-window selections to stable window IDs before the watch capture loop starts.
- MCP `capture` now honors `window_title`, resolves explicit title/index window selections to stable window IDs, and rejects ambiguous `window_index` without an app or PID.
- Element-targeted CLI and MCP interaction commands now apply title-over-index precedence when both window selectors are provided.
- Window management commands now use one resolver for listing, refetching, and mutating windows, so `--pid` targets and title/index precedence stay consistent across close/minimize/maximize/move/resize/focus.

### Performance
- Menu bar listing is faster by avoiding redundant accessibility work.
- Exact window-ID metadata refreshes now use a CoreGraphics lookup before falling back to all-app AX enumeration, making already-known window focus/list refreshes substantially faster.
- Dialog discovery and visualizer dispatch now fail fast when their target UI is unavailable instead of waiting through slow default paths.
- `peekaboo tools` and read-only `peekaboo list` inventory commands now default to local execution instead of probing bridge sockets first, shaving roughly 30-35ms from warm catalog/window-list calls when no bridge is in use. Pass `--bridge-socket` to target a bridge explicitly.
- `peekaboo image --app` avoids redundant application/window-count lookups during screenshot setup and skips auto-focus work when the target app is already frontmost.
- `peekaboo image --app` now uses a CoreGraphics-only window selection fast path before falling back to full AX-enriched window enumeration, reducing warm Playground screenshot capture from about 350ms to 290ms.
- `peekaboo image` now defaults to local capture instead of probing bridge sockets first, reducing default warm app screenshot calls from about 330ms to 290ms when no bridge is in use. Pass `--bridge-socket` to target a bridge explicitly.
- `peekaboo see` now defaults to local execution instead of probing bridge sockets first, cutting warm Playground screenshot-plus-AX calls from about 844ms to 759ms when no bridge is in use. Pass `--bridge-socket` to target a bridge explicitly.
- `peekaboo image` skips a redundant CLI-side screen-recording preflight and relies on the capture service's permission check, shaving about 8ms from warm one-shot app screenshots.
- `peekaboo see --app` avoids re-focusing the target window when Accessibility already reports the captured window as focused.
- `peekaboo see` avoids recursive AX child-text lookups for elements whose labels cannot use them, reducing Playground element detection from about 201ms to 134ms in local testing.
- `peekaboo see` batches per-element Accessibility descriptor reads and avoids action/editability probes when the role already determines behavior, reducing local Playground element detection from about 205ms to 176ms.
- `peekaboo see` limits expensive AX action and keyboard-shortcut probes to roles that can use them, reducing Playground element detection from about 286ms to roughly 180-190ms in local testing.
- `peekaboo see` skips a redundant CLI-side screen-recording preflight and relies on the capture service's permission check, shaving a fixed TCC probe from screenshot-plus-AX runs.
- `peekaboo see` now keeps AX traversal scoped to the captured window and skips web-content focus probing once a rich native AX tree is already visible, avoiding sibling-window elements and cutting native Playground detection from about 220ms to 130ms.
- `peekaboo see --app Playground` now runs through the observation facade in about 0.50s locally, with capture and AX detection spans reported separately.

- Menu bar automation overhaul: CGWindow + AX fallback for menu extras (including Trimmy), `menubar click --verify` + `menu click-extra --verify` with popover/focus/OCR checks, and `see --menubar` popover capture via window list + OCR.
- Screen/area capture pipeline now uses a persistent ScreenCaptureKit fast stream (frame-age + wait timing logs) with single-shot fallback for windows.

### Added
- `peekaboo clipboard --verify` reads back clipboard writes; text writes now publish both `public.plain-text` and `.string` across CLI, MCP tools, paste, and scripts.
- `peekaboo dock launch --verify`, `peekaboo window focus --verify`, and `peekaboo app switch --verify` add lightweight post-action checks.
- `peekaboo app list` now supports `--include-hidden` and `--include-background`.
- Release artifacts now ship a universal macOS CLI binary (arm64 + x86_64).

### Changed
- AX element detection now caches per-window traversals for ~1.5s to reduce repeated `see` thrash; window list mapping is now centralized and cached to cut CG/SC re-queries.
- Menu bar popover selection now prefers owner-name matches and X-position hints; owner-PID filtering relaxes when app hints do not match any candidate.
- Menu bar screenshot captures now use the real menu bar height derived from each screen’s visible frame.
- `peekaboo see --menubar` now attempts an OCR area fallback after auto-clicking a menu extra even when open-menu AX state is missing.

### Fixed
- Menu bar extras now combine CGWindow data with AX fallbacks to surface third-party items like Trimmy, and clicks target the owning window for reliability.
- Menu bar extras now hydrate missing owner PIDs from running app metadata to improve open-menu detection.
- Menu bar open-menu probing now returns AX menu frames over the bridge to support popover captures.
- Menu bar verification now detects focused-window changes when a menu bar app opens a settings window.
- Menu bar click verification now detects popovers in both top-left and bottom-left coordinate systems.
- Menu bar click verification now requires OCR text to include the target title/owner name when falling back to OCR (set `PEEKABOO_MENUBAR_OCR_VERIFY=0` to disable).
- Menu bar popover OCR area/frame fallbacks now validate against app hints before accepting a capture.

## [3.0.0-beta2] - 2025-12-19

### Highlights
- **Socket-based Peekaboo Bridge**: privileged automation runs in a long-lived **bridge host** (Peekaboo.app, or another signed host like Clawdbot.app) and the CLI connects over a UNIX socket (replacing the v3.0.0-beta1 XPC helper model).
- **Snapshots replace sessions**: snapshots live in memory by default, are scoped **per target bundle ID**, and are reused automatically for follow-up actions (agent-friendly; fewer IDs to plumb around).
- **MCP server-only**: Peekaboo still runs as an MCP server for Claude Desktop/Cursor/etc, but no longer hosts/manages external MCP servers.
- **Reliability upgrades for “single action” automation**: hard wall-clock timeouts and bounded AX traversal to prevent hangs.
- **Visualizer extracted + stabilized**: overlay UI lives in `PeekabooVisualizer`, with improved preview timings and less clipping.

### Breaking
- Removed the v3.0.0-beta1 XPC helper pathway; remote execution now uses the **Peekaboo Bridge** socket host model.
- Renamed automation “sessions” → “snapshots” across CLI output, cache/paths, and APIs.
- Removed external MCP client support (`peekaboo mcp add/list/test/call/enable/disable` removed); `peekaboo mcp` now defaults to `serve`, and `mcpClients` configuration is no longer supported.
- CLI builds now target **macOS 15+**.

### Added
- `peekaboo paste`: set clipboard content, paste (Cmd+V), then restore the prior clipboard (text, files/images, base64 payloads).
- Deterministic window targeting via `--window-id` to avoid title/index ambiguity.
- `peekaboo bridge status` diagnostics for host selection/handshake/security; plus runtime controls `--bridge-socket` and `--no-remote`.
- Bridge security: caller validation via **code signature TeamID allowlist** (and optional bundle allowlist), with a **debug-only** same-UID escape hatch (`PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1`).
- `peekaboo hotkey` accepts the key combo as a positional argument (in addition to `--keys`) for quick one-liners like `peekaboo hotkey "cmd,shift,t"`.
- `peekaboo learn` renders its guide as ANSI-styled markdown on rich terminals, while still emitting plain markdown when piped.
- Agent providers now include `gemini-3-flash`, expanding the out-of-the-box model catalog for `peekaboo agent`.
- Agent streaming loop now injects `DESKTOP_STATE` (focused app/window title, cursor position, and clipboard preview when the `clipboard` tool is enabled) as untrusted, delimited context to improve situational awareness.
- Peekaboo’s macOS app now surfaces About/Updates inside Settings (Sparkle update checks when signed/bundled).

### Changed
- Bridge host discovery order is now: **Peekaboo.app → Clawdbot.app → local in-process** (no auto-launch).
- Capture defaults favor the classic engine for speed/reliability, with explicit capture-engine flags when you need SCKit behavior.
- Agent defaults now prefer Claude Opus 4.5 when available, with improved streaming output for supported providers.
- OpenAI model aliases now map to the latest GPT-5.1 variants for `peekaboo agent`.

### Fixed
- ScreenCaptureKit window capture no longer returns black frames for GPU-rendered windows (notably iOS Simulator), and display-bound crops now use display-local `sourceRect` coordinates on secondary monitors.
- `peekaboo see` is now bounded for “single action” use (10s wall-clock timeout without `--analyze`), and timeouts surface as `TIMEOUT` exit codes instead of silent hangs.
- Dialog file automation is more reliable: can force “Show Details” (`--ensure-expanded`) and verifies the saved path when possible.
- `peekaboo dialog` subcommands now expose the full interaction targeting + focus options (Commander parity).
- App resolution now prioritizes exact name matches over bundleID-contains matches, preventing `--app Safari` from accidentally matching helper processes with “Safari” in their bundle ID.
- UI element detection enforces conservative traversal limits (depth/node/child caps) plus a detection deadline, making runaway AX trees safe.
- Listing apps via a bridge no longer risks timing out: window counts now use CGWindowList instead of per-app AX enumeration.
- Visualizer previews now respect their full duration before fading out; overlays no longer disappear in ~0.3s regardless of requested timing.
- `peekaboo image`: infer output encoding from `--path` extension when `--format` is omitted, and reject conflicting `--format` vs `--path` extension values.
- `peekaboo image --analyze`: Ollama vision models are now supported.
- `peekaboo click --coords` no longer crashes on invalid input; invalid coordinates now fail with a structured validation error.
- Auto-focus no longer no-ops when a snapshot is missing a `windowID`, preventing follow-up actions from landing in the wrong frontmost app.
- `peekaboo window list` no longer returns duplicate entries for the same window.
- `peekaboo capture live` avoids window-index mismatches that could attach to the wrong window when multiple candidates are present.
- Bridge hosts that reject the CLI now reply with a structured `unauthorizedClient` error response instead of closing the socket (EOF), and the CLI error message includes actionable guidance for older hosts.

## [3.0.0-beta1] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- Tool allow/deny filters now log when a tool is hidden, including whether the rule came from environment variables or config, and tests cover the messaging.
- `peekaboo image --retina` captures at native HiDPI scale (2x on Retina) with scale-aware bounds in the capture pipeline, plus docs and tests to lock in the behavior.
- Peekaboo now inherits Tachikoma’s Azure OpenAI provider and refreshed model catalog (GPT‑5.1 family as default, updated Grok/Gemini 2.5 IDs), and the `tk-config` helper is exposed through the provider config flow for easier credential setup.
- Full GUI automation commands—`see`, `click`, `type`, `press`, `scroll`, `hotkey`, and `swipe`—now ship in the CLI with multi-screen capture so you can identify elements on any display and act on them without leaving the terminal.
- Natural-language AI agent flows (`peekaboo agent "…"` or simply `peekaboo "…"`) let you describe multi-step tasks in prose; the agent chains native tools, emits verbose traces, and supports low-level hotkeys when you need to fall back to precise control.
- Dedicated window management, multi-screen, and Spaces commands (`window`, `space`) give you scripted control over closing, moving, resizing, and re-homing macOS apps, including presets like left/right halves and cross-display moves.
- Menu tooling now enumerates every application menu plus system menu extras, enabling zero-click discovery of keyboard shortcuts and scripted menu activation via `menu list`, `menu list-all`, `menu click`, and `menu click-extra`.
- Automation snapshots remember the most recent `see` run automatically, but you can also pin explicit snapshot IDs and run `.peekaboo.json` scripts via `peekaboo run` to reproduce complex workflows with one command.
- Rounded out the CLI command surface so every capture, interaction, and maintenance workflow is first-class: `image`, `list`, `tools`, `config`, `permissions`, `learn`, `run`, `sleep`, and `clean` cover capture/config glue, while `window`, `app`, `dock`, `dialog`, `space`, `menu`, and `menubar` provide window, app, and UI chrome management alongside the previously mentioned automation commands.
- `peekaboo see --json` now includes `description`, `role_description`, and `help` fields for every `ui_elements[]` entry so toolbar icons (like the Wingman extension) and other AX-only descriptions can be located without blind coordinate clicks.
- GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1 Mini, and GPT-5.1 Nano are now fully supported across the CLI, macOS app, and MCP bridge. `peekaboo agent` defaults to `gpt-5.1`, the app’s AI settings expose the new variants, and all MCP tool banners reflect the upgraded default.

### Integrations
- Peekaboo runs as both an MCP server and client: it still exposes its native tools to Claude/Cursor, but v3 now ships the Chrome DevTools MCP by default and lets you add or toggle external MCP servers (`peekaboo mcp list/add/test/enable/disable`), so the agent can mix native Mac automation with remote browser, GitHub, or filesystem tools in a single session.

### Developer Workflow
- Added `pnpm` shortcuts for common Swift workflows (`pnpm build`, `pnpm build:cli:release`, `pnpm build:polter`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:automation`, `pnpm test:all`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`) so command names match what ships in release docs and both humans and agents rely on the same entry points.
- Automation test suites now launch the freshly built `.build/debug/peekaboo` binary via `CLITestEnvironment.peekabooBinaryURL()` and suppress negative parsing noise, making CI logs far easier to scan.
- Documented the safe vs. automation tagging convention and the new command shorthands inside `docs/swift-testing-playbook.md`, so contributors know exactly which suites to run before tagging.
- `AudioInputService` now relies on Swift observation (`@Observable`) plus structured `Task.sleep` polling instead of Combine timers, keeping v3’s audio capture aligned with Swift 6.2’s concurrency expectations.
- CLI `tools` output now uses `OrderedDictionary`, guaranteeing the same ordering every time you list tools or dump JSON so copy/paste instructions in the README stay accurate.
- Removed the Gemini CLI reusable workflow from CI to eliminate an external check that was blocking pull requests when no Gemini credentials are configured.

### Changed
- Provider configuration now prefers environment overrides while still loading stored credentials, matching the latest Tachikoma behavior and keeping CI/config files in sync.
- Commands invoked without arguments (for example `peekaboo agent` or `peekaboo see`) now print their detailed help, including argument/flag tables and curated usage examples, so it is obvious why input is required.
- CLI help output now hides compatibility aliases such as `--jsonOutput` while still documenting the primary short/long names (`-j`, `--json`), matching the new alias metadata exported by the Commander submodule.

### Fixed
- `peekaboo capture video` positional input now binds correctly through Commander, preventing “missing input” runtime errors; binder and parsing tests cover the regression.
- Menubar automation uses a bundled LSUIElement helper before CGS fallbacks, improving detection of menu extras on macOS 26+.
- Agent MCP tools (see/click/drag/type/scroll) default to the latest `see` session when none is pinned, so follow-up actions work without re-running `see`.
- MCP Responses image payloads are normalized (URL/base64) to align with the schema; manual testing guidance updated.
- Restored Playground target build on macOS 15 so local examples compile again.
- `peekaboo capture video --sample-fps` now reports frame timestamps from the video timeline (not session wall-clock), fixing bunched `t=XXms` outputs and aligning `metadata.json`; regression test added.
- `peekaboo capture video` now advertises and binds its required input video file in Commander help/registry, preventing missing-input crashes; binder and program-resolution tests cover the regression.
- Anthropic OAuth token exchange now uses standards-compliant form encoding, fixing 400 responses during `peekaboo config login anthropic`; regression test added.
- `peekaboo see --analyze` now honors `aiProviders.providers` when choosing the default model instead of always defaulting to OpenAI; coverage added for configured defaults.
- Added more coverage to ensure AI provider precedence honors provider lists, Anthropic-only keys, and empty/default fallbacks.
- Visualizer “Peekaboo.app is not running” notice now only appears with verbose logging, keeping default runs quieter.
- Visualizer console output is now suppressed unless verbose-level logging is explicitly requested (or forced via `PEEKABOO_VISUALIZER_STDOUT`), preventing non-verbose runs from emitting visualizer chatter.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
- Fixed `--version` output to include "Peekaboo" prefix for Homebrew formula compatibility
- Now outputs "Peekaboo 2.0.3" instead of just "2.0.3"

## [2.0.2] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
- Actually fixed compatibility with macOS Sequoia 26 by ensuring LC_UUID load command is generated during linking
- The v2.0.1 fix was incomplete - the binary was still missing LC_UUID
- Verified both x86_64 and arm64 architectures now contain proper LC_UUID load commands

## [2.0.1] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
- Fixed compatibility with macOS Sequoia 26 (pre-release) by preserving LC_UUID load command during binary stripping
